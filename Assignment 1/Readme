Write python codes and build logistic regression classifiers on breast cancer dataset to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign on the patients.
What I have done:
•Load data, clean data and partition them into training and testing data.
•Build logistic regression and L2-regularized logistic regression models.
•Implement three gradient descent algorithms for each model: Batch Gradient Descent (GD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MB-SGD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
•Compare the loss curve of three gradient descent algorithms (GD/MB-SGD/SGD).
•Compare logistic regression and regularized version in terms of training and testing error.
•Try to tune different parameters (regularization parameter, learning rate, etc.) to see their effects.
